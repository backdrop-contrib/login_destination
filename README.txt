Description
-----------------
This module controls where users go after logging in:
- a static URL or 
- your PHP snippet's outputed places (see below).

You can also use alias URLs instead of internal paths.

If you want to redirect a user to an URL with a query (parameters specified in GET),
you should return an array instead of a string of the following format:
    return array('path' => 'node/add/video', 'query' => 'param1=100&param2=200');

You can also configure from which pages redirection is applied.
To achieve this you can specify either a list of URLs or a PHP snippet to build this list dynamically.
So, you can redirect user to various pages depending on which pages they are logging from.


Configuration
-----------------
All configuration is performed on an Configuration -> System -> Login destination page
(admin/config/system/login_destination).

Note that the PHP filter module has to enabled and you have to be granted the "Use PHP for settings" permissions to be able to enter PHP snippets.

Examples
-----------------

PHP snippet for redirection URL should return a string. Here is an example:

  global $user;
  if ($user->uid == 1) {
    // Redirect the Administrator
    return 'admin';
  } elseif ($user->uid == 2) {
    // Redirect the Site Owner to 'create video' page
    return array('path' => 'node/add/video', 'query' => 'param1=100&param2=200');
  } else {
    return 'node';
  }

PHP snippet for Redirection condition should return boolean value. An example is:

  return ($_GET['q'] == 'user/login');

Remeber to put PHP tags when creating snippets.

Turn on "Preserve the destination parameter" feature to make module sensible to destination parameter.
When login from the path with specified destination (ex: 'any-page?destination=node/18')
you will be taken to node/18 instead of the URL specified in login_destination settings.

$_SESSION['login_page'] was added and stores the page you were before clicking login form button.
You can use it to determine the page you logged from instead of $_GET['q'] because $_GET['q']
always equals to 'login_redirect'.
